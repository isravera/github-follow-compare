### Github Follow Compare

I made this tool because there where people following me (so I followed them back) and after some time they just unfollow me and I didn't want to follow those kind of people (maybe bots or scripts).

### ⚒️ How does it work

My first idea was to create a simple list of users and show me a button to follow or unfollow them as appropriate, but the Github API was returning a 404 error, so I decided to simply show 2 lists and compare hand who to follow and who to unfollow.

First you will need a "Personal Access Token" [Get it Here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) were you need to add a name, expiration date and check the users scope, then copy and paste that token into the app.js first line.
